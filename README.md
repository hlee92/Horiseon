1. Changed the name of the title to something more descriptive than "Website".
2. Added descriptive alt tags after every img src in case user can't see the icons and made sure the links correspond and takes you to the correct part of the website. 
3. Changed most of the div elements to more appropriate tags.
4. Condensed and consolidated the CSS by eliminating repeat codes that can be grouped together.
5. Replaced and added words with ones that would were vital to the functionality of the code. For example, replacing "class" with "Id" and adding class="".
